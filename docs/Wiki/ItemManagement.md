## Commands

### Repair & Disposal

| Command | Syntax | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/repair` | `/repair [hand\|all]` | `neoessentials.item.repair` | Repair held item or all items |
| `/fix` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/dispose` | `/dispose` | `neoessentials.item.dispose` | Open a disposal chest (items placed are destroyed) |
| `/trash` | alias | same | Alias |

### Inventory

| Command | Syntax | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/clearinventory` | `/clearinventory [player]` | `neoessentials.item.clearinventory` | Clear inventory |
| `/ci` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/clearinv` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/ciconfirmtoggle` | `/ciconfirmtoggle` | `neoessentials.ciconfirmtoggle` | Toggle confirmation prompt for `/ci` (own dedicated node, distinct from `neoessentials.item.clearinventory`) |
| `/clearinventoryconfirmtoggle` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/invsee` | `/invsee <player>` | `neoessentials.invsee` | View a player's inventory (read-only) |
| `/inv` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/invseeedit` | `/invseeedit <player>` | `neoessentials.invsee.edit` | View and **edit** a player's inventory |
| `/enderchest` | `/enderchest [player]` | `neoessentials.enderchest` | View a player's ender chest (read-only) |
| `/ec` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/enderchestedit` | `/enderchestedit <player>` | `neoessentials.enderchest.edit` | View and **edit** a player's ender chest |
| `/ecedit` | alias | same | Alias |

> **⚠️ Security fix (build.40)** — Prior to build.40, `/inv` and `/ec` were registered as Brigadier `redirect()` nodes with no `requires()` predicate, which meant any player could bypass permission checks and open another player's inventory or ender chest. This has been fixed; each alias now carries its own permission check.  
> `neoessentials.invsee` and `neoessentials.enderchest` are granted to the **moderator** group by default.
| `/condense` | `/condense [item]` | `neoessentials.condense` | Compact loose items to storage blocks |

### Item Customisation

| Command | Syntax | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/itemname` | `/itemname [name\|-]` | `neoessentials.itemname` | Rename held item (omit or `-` to clear) |
| `/rename` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/itemlore` | `/itemlore add\|set <n>\|remove <n>\|clear <text>` | `neoessentials.itemlore` | Edit held item lore lines |
| `/more` | `/more [amount]` | `neoessentials.more` | Fill held stack to max |
| `/hat` | `/hat` | `neoessentials.hat` | Wear held item as helmet |
| `/item` | `/item <id> [amount]` | `neoessentials.item` | Give yourself an item by registry ID |
| `/i` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/skull` | `/skull [player]` | `neoessentials.skull` | Get a player head item |

### Enchanting

| Command | Syntax | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/enchant` | `/enchant <enchantment> [level]` | `neoessentials.item.enchant` | Enchant held item (overrides vanilla `/enchant`) |
| `/enchant <player> <enchantment> [level]` | `/enchant <player> <enchantment> [level]` | `neoessentials.item.enchant.others` | Enchant another player's held item |
| `/ench` | alias for `/enchant` | same | Alias |
| `/enchanthand` | `/enchanthand <enchantment> [level]` | `neoessentials.item.enchant` | Hand-only enchant command, gated independently of `/enchant` (its own config toggle) |
| `/potion` | `/potion add <effect> [duration] [amp]` · `/potion clear` | `neoessentials.potion` | Edit potion effects on held potion (no `remove` subcommand — use `clear` to remove all) |

`neoessentials.item.enchant.unsafe` allows enchant levels/combinations beyond vanilla limits; `neoessentials.item.enchant.any` allows enchanting item types the enchantment wouldn't normally apply to. Both are checked internally by `/enchant` — they aren't separate commands.

### Powertool

| Command | Syntax | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/powertool` | `/powertool <command>` | `neoessentials.item.powertool` | Bind a command to held item type |
| `/powertool remove` | `/powertool remove` | same | Remove powertool from held item |
| `/powertool list` | `/powertool list` | same | List all your powertool bindings |
| `/ptool` | alias | same | Alias (full command tree, not just an alias name) |
| `/powertooltoggle` | `/powertooltoggle` | *(none — open to any player)* | Toggle all powertools on/off |
| `/ptt` | alias | same | Alias |
| `/powertoollist` | `/powertoollist` | `neoessentials.powertoollist` | List active powertool bindings |
| `/ptlist` | alias | same | Alias |

> **Note:** `/powertooltoggle` and `/ptt` have no dedicated permission node — any player who can run commands can toggle their own powertools on/off. `/powertoollist`/`/ptlist` use a separate `neoessentials.powertoollist` node, distinct from `neoessentials.item.powertool` (which gates binding/removing/listing via the `/powertool` command itself).

**How powertools work:**
- Bindings are stored by **item type** (not slot) — the command travels with the item regardless of which inventory slot it's in
- Right-clicking with the item (on a block, mob, or in air) executes the bound command as you
- `/powertooltoggle` globally enables/disables all your powertools without removing bindings
- Use `@p <command>` syntax to execute the command on all other online players

**Command Safety Filter**

Before a command is accepted by `/powertool`, NeoEssentials runs it through a safety check.  
If the command is rejected you will see:

```
Command contains potentially dangerous operations. Enable 'allowUnsafeCommands' in config to use this command.
```
or
```
Command contains unsafe characters. Enable 'allowUnsafeCommands' in config to use special characters.
```

**Commands that work without any config change** (common examples):

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/give @s minecraft:diamond 1` | Standard item give |
| `/effect give @s minecraft:speed 30 1` | Potion effect |
| `/gamemode creative` | Mode switch |
| `/say Hello` | Chat message |
| `/neoe heal` | NeoEssentials shortcut |

**Commands blocked when `allowUnsafeCommands` is `false`:**

| Command | Blocked because |
|---|---|
| `/tp ~ 100 ~` | Contains `~` (relative coords) |
| `/tp ~0 ~10 ~0` | Contains `~` |
| `/execute as @a run ...` | Contains `@` |
| `/tellraw @a {"text":"hi"}` | Contains `@` and `{` |
| `/give @s shulker_box{Items:[]}` | Contains `@` and `{` |

> **`allowUnsafeCommands` ships `true` by default** — the patterns above are **not** blocked out
> of the box. Set it to `false` if you want powertool bindings restricted to the simpler patterns
> in the "works without any config change" table above; leave it `true` (the default) to allow
> the full range of commands, including relative coordinates and selectors, in a powertool
> binding.
>
> - **Split config mode:** `config/neoessentials/security.json` → `security.allowUnsafeCommands`
> - **Monolithic mode:** `config/neoessentials/config.json` → `security.allowUnsafeCommands`

Then run `/neoe reload` — no restart needed.

> ℹ️ Full details, all blocked patterns, and security advice are in [SplitConfigs — Security Configuration](SplitConfigs#security-configuration-securityjson).
