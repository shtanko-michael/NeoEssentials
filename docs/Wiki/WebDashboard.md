# Web Dashboard

> **Version:** 1.0.5+build.54 · **Config:** `config.json` → `webDashboard` section (dashboard on/off is controlled by **both** `webDashboard.enabled` **and** `modules.webDashboardEnabled` — either one set to `false` disables it)

---

## Overview

NeoEssentials runs an embedded HTTP server (plus a WebSocket server for live updates) exposing a
full REST API for server monitoring and administration. There are now **two ways to actually use
it**, controlled by `webDashboard.mode`:

- **`"external"` (the shipped default)** — the mod serves only `/api/*`; a separately-hosted
  dashboard app (the `NeoEssentials-Dashboard` Laravel project) is the actual browser UI, talking
  to this API from outside. See [API System](APISystem) and [`docs/API.md`](../API.md) for the
  full REST/WebSocket reference it's built against.
- **`"internal"` / `"both"`** — the mod serves its **own** bundled dashboard UI directly from `/`,
  no separate app to install at all. As of build.13 this internal UI is feature-complete and
  covers the same ground as the external app: Overview, Players (with a full per-player control
  page), Economy, Warps, Kits, Holograms, Discord, dashboard account management, Backups,
  Commands, Logs, Permissions, a public no-login player-lookup page, and (as of build.15) an
  account Settings page — see [Account Settings & Minecraft Account Linking](#account-settings--minecraft-account-linking)
  below. `"both"` is just an explicit alias for `"internal"`, useful when you deliberately run the
  built-in UI *and* point an external app at the same API at the same time.

The account system, permission model, and moderation/economy/etc. backing data described below
are shared by both dashboards — they're the same accounts and data either one authenticates
against and reads/writes through the API.

---

## Setup

1. Set `webDashboard.enabled: true` **and** `modules.webDashboardEnabled: true` in `config.json` (both default to `true`)
2. Configure `port` (default `8080`) and `websocketPort` (default `8081`)
3. Start the server, then run `/dashboard start` (`webDashboard.autoStart` ships `false`, so the
   API server doesn't come up on its own unless you set `autoStart: true`)
4. Create a credential for whatever's going to call the API:
   - **An external dashboard backend (recommended path):** create an API key in-game —
     `/apikey create <label> [role]` — and give the printed token to that dashboard's server
     config. See [API System → Authentication](APISystem#authentication) for the full picture.
   - **A human dashboard account:** register in-game via `/dashboardregister start` then
     `/dashboardregister complete <username> <password>` (or `/dashboardregister discord` if
     Simple Discord Link is linked) — or use one of the other paths below.
5. Point your external dashboard app at `http://<server-ip>:<port>/api/...` (`port` from step 2)
   using the API key or session token as a Bearer token.

---

## Account Registration

Players register their dashboard account **in-game**, via the separate `/dashboardregister`
command (not a subcommand of `/dashboard`) — they do not need to be online at login time after
registering.

```
/dashboardregister start
/dashboardregister complete <username> <password>
```

Or, if Simple Discord Link, Mc2Discord, or DCIntegration is installed and the player has linked their Discord account:

```
/dashboardregister discord
```

Requires permission `neoessentials.dashboard.access`. Registration tokens from `start` expire
after 5 minutes; passwords must be at least 8 characters. Run `/dashboardregister status` to
check your current registration state.

**Other ways to get dashboard access:**

1. **API key (for an external dashboard backend, not a human)** — `/apikey create <label>
   [role]` in-game, or `POST /api/apikeys` once a first key exists. Not a login account at all;
   see [API System](APISystem) and `docs/API.md`.
2. **Default admin account** — the first time the dashboard starts with no accounts at all, an
   `admin` account is auto-created with a **random** temporary password, printed once to the
   server console/log (`Temporary password: ...`) and flagged to require a password change on
   first login. There is no fixed default password — check the boot log if you've lost it, or
   reset it via `/api/users/{id}/password` (admin session) if you still have another admin
   account.
3. **Minecraft-permission login (self-service, works offline, deprecated)** — on the login page,
   authenticate with just your Minecraft username (no password). The server checks whether that
   player has `neoessentials.dashboard.access` and auto-creates an account with role assigned
   from `neoessentials.dashboard.admin`/`.moderator`/`.access`. Predates the `/dashboardregister`
   flow above and is marked deprecated in server logs, but still functional.
4. **Discord OAuth (optional, self-service)** — see below. If `allowAutoRegistration: true`
   (the default), logging in with Discord auto-creates an account on first use.
5. **Admin-created accounts** — an existing admin can create accounts directly via
   `POST /api/users/create` (or whatever user-management screen the external dashboard exposes
   for it), or push-sync one from the external dashboard's own user table with
   `POST /api/users/sync` — see `docs/API.md`.

### Discord Auth (Optional)

If a supported Discord companion mod — **Simple Discord Link** or **Mc2Discord** — is installed, players can link
their Discord account, and the dashboard can source their Discord identity and roles from it. The mod is fully
optional — standalone account registration works without it.

---

## Discord-Linked Dashboard Identity

NeoEssentials does **not** talk to Discord's API directly — no bot token, no OAuth2 code exchange, no REST calls to
`discord.com`. All Discord communication is delegated entirely to whichever companion mod is installed
(Simple Discord Link or Mc2Discord); NeoEssentials only reads the account-link data that mod already has.

### How It Works

```
Player links their account in-game (via SDLink's or Mc2Discord's own commands)
         │
         ▼
ChatIntegrationManager.findLinkedDiscordId(uuid)  ── checks whichever companion mod is ready
         │
         ▼
DiscordAuthProvider  ── resolves Discord ID + role IDs for that player
         │
         ▼
Dashboard: GET /api/auth/discord?username=<name>
  1. Look up the linked Discord account
  2. Check blacklist / whitelist roles
  3. Map Discord roles → dashboard role
  4. Get-or-create dashboard user, create session
```

There is no "Login with Discord" OAuth2 button — a player must first link their account in-game through
Simple Discord Link's or Mc2Discord's own linking flow.

### Companion mods

| Mod | Chat relay | Account link lookup | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple Discord Link (SDLink) | ✅ | ✅ | Real compile-time API (`com.hypherionmc.sdlink.api.*`), also requires CraterLib |
| Mc2Discord | ✅ | ✅ | Real compile-time API (`fr.denisd3d.mc2discord.core.*`) |
| DCIntegration | — (self-relays) | ✅ | Real compile-time API (`de.erdbeerbaerlp.dcintegration.common.*`). Relays chat/join/leave/commands to Discord on its own via mixins — NeoEssentials doesn't push those events to it, only reads account links |
| DiscordSRV | ❌ | ❌ | Not supported — it's a Bukkit/Paper plugin and cannot run on a NeoForge server |

Detection is purely runtime (`ModList.isLoaded(...)`) — neither mod is a hard dependency, and NeoEssentials works
fine standalone if neither is installed.

### Config (`discord_auth.json`)

Located at `config/neoessentials/discord_auth.json`. Auto-generated on first start.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable Discord-linked dashboard identity/login |
| `requireLinkedAccount` | `true` | Require the player's Minecraft account to actually be linked to Discord |
| `allowAutoRegistration` | `true` | Auto-create a dashboard account on first Discord-linked login |
| `defaultRole` | `VIEWER` | Dashboard role given when no Discord role is mapped |

#### Role mapping

Discord role IDs (not names) are mapped to dashboard roles. Enable **Developer Mode** in Discord Settings → Advanced, then right-click a role → **Copy ID**.

```json
"roleMapping": {
  "123456789012345678": "ADMIN",
  "234567890123456789": "MODERATOR",
  "345678901234567890": "VIEWER"
}
```

#### Whitelist / Blacklist

```json
"whitelistedRoles":  ["123456789012345678"],   // only these role IDs can log in (empty = everyone)
"blacklistedUsers":  ["987654321098765432"]    // these Discord user IDs are always denied
```

### Without a Discord companion mod

If none of SDLink, Mc2Discord, or DCIntegration is installed, `GET /api/auth/discord` returns `503` — Discord-linked
login is unavailable entirely (there's no account-link data to read). Standalone username/password login
is unaffected.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/auth/discord/status` reports `linkAdapterAvailable: false` | No supported companion mod is installed, or its bot connection isn't ready yet |
| "No Discord account linked" error | Player hasn't linked their account in-game via the companion mod's own command |
| "does not have a whitelisted role" | User doesn't hold one of the `whitelistedRoles` IDs |

---

## Config (`config.json` → `webDashboard`)

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable the dashboard system |
| `autoStart` | `false` | Start dashboard on server boot. If `false` (the shipped default), start it manually with `/dashboard start` |
| `port` | `8080` | HTTP port |
| `websocketPort` | `8081` | WebSocket port for live updates |
| `bindAddress` | `"0.0.0.0"` | IP to bind (use `127.0.0.1` for local-only) |
| `mode` | `"external"` | `"external"` serves only `/api/*` (default — use with the separate `NeoEssentials-Dashboard` app). `"internal"`/`"both"` also serves the mod's own bundled dashboard UI at `/` — see [Dashboard Connectivity](DashboardConnectivity) |
| `userSyncWebhookUrl` | `""` (disabled) | Optional: POST a notification here whenever a dashboard_user is created/updated/deleted, so an external dashboard can mirror the change into its own user table. See `docs/API.md` |
| `userSyncWebhookSecret` | `""` | HMAC-SHA256 secret for signing the webhook above (`X-NeoEssentials-Signature` header) |
| `securitySettings.requireAuthentication` | `true` | Require a Bearer token (session or API key) on dashboard API endpoints |
| `securitySettings.enableRateLimiting` | `true` | Enable per-IP rate limiting on the dashboard API |
| `securitySettings.maxRequestsPerMinute` | `60` | Max API requests per IP per minute when rate limiting is enabled |
| `securitySettings.publicModerationLookupEnabled` | `true` | Enable the no-login `/api/public/moderation/*` routes (see below) |
| `roleSync.enabled` | `false` | Opt-in: automatically sync a linked player's dashboard role from their real in-game permission — see [Dashboard Security](#dashboard-security) above |
| `roleSync.intervalSeconds` | `300` | How often the periodic reconciliation sweep runs, in addition to an immediate check on join |
| `roleSync.adminPermission` | `"neoessentials.admin.dashboard"` | A player with this permission node is granted the dashboard `ADMIN` role |
| `roleSync.adminGroup` | `"admin"` | A player in this permission group is granted the dashboard `ADMIN` role (checked in addition to, i.e. OR'd with, `adminPermission`) |

The dashboard's on/off switch is now split across two keys that both have to allow it:
`webDashboard.enabled` (this section) **and** `modules.webDashboardEnabled` (the mod-wide
`modules` block at the top of `config.json`, alongside `economyEnabled`/`chatEnabled`/etc.).
Either one set to `false` disables the whole dashboard.

> The `apiSettings`, `uiSettings`, `loggingSettings`, `enableCORS`, and `maxThreads` keys from
> earlier documentation do not exist in the current codebase — the dashboard's security-related
> settings live entirely under `securitySettings`, and there is no config option to disable REST
> endpoints or config editing independently.

---

## What the Dashboard Can Do

Both the internal (bundled) and external (Laravel) dashboards cover the same 13 pages, since both
are built against the same REST API: Overview (`/api/stats` + `/api/server`), Players + full
per-player control page (`/api/player` + `/api/moderation`), Economy, Warps, Kits, Holograms,
Discord, dashboard account management (`/api/users`), Backups, Commands/console (`/api/commands`),
Logs (`/api/logging`), Permissions (`/api/permissions`), and a public no-login player-lookup page.
Full endpoint detail in [API System](APISystem) → `docs/API.md`.

### Account Settings & Minecraft Account Linking

Both dashboards have an account Settings/Profile page (the internal one gained this in build.15;
it was previously just a disabled "not yet ported" placeholder) covering:

- **Change password** — same on both dashboards.
- **Link a Minecraft account** — new this pass, and the first way to do this *without* needing
  Discord: the Settings page generates a short one-time code, and you type
  `/linkaccount <code>` in-game to confirm ownership. Works for any dashboard account regardless
  of how it was created (self-registered, admin-created, or via `/dashboardregister`). Self-service
  unlink is also available. See `docs/API.md`'s `/api/auth/link-minecraft/*` routes.
- **Discord status** — read-only on the internal dashboard (resolved via whichever Discord
  companion mod is installed — see [below](#discord-linked-dashboard-identity)); the external
  dashboard keeps its existing full OAuth2 "Connect Discord" flow. A genuine browser-initiated
  Discord OAuth2 flow for the internal dashboard (so it gets the same "Connect Discord" button) is
  a planned follow-up, not built yet — the mod deliberately doesn't perform Discord OAuth2 itself
  today (see `DiscordAuthProvider`'s own doc comment).
- Once linked, the sidebar's user avatar on both dashboards shows your actual Minecraft skin
  instead of a generic icon.

### Dashboard Security

- `/apikey create` now prints the generated token as a click-to-copy chat component instead of
  plain text.
- The external dashboard's paired auth token (the Bearer token it presents on its outbound
  account-sync webhook) is now encrypted at rest in `config.json` (AES-256-GCM) instead of stored
  in plaintext — existing plaintext values are migrated transparently the next time they're read,
  no action needed.
- New opt-in setting, `webDashboard.roleSync` (off by default): automatically grants a linked
  player's dashboard account the `ADMIN` role the moment they have a configured in-game permission
  node or belong to a configured permission group, and revokes it again the moment they don't — no
  more manually re-running `/apikey create`/the API every time an admin's in-game status changes.
  Runs an immediate check on join plus a periodic sweep, so it also catches permission changes made
  outside the mod entirely (e.g. a direct LuckPerms edit). Never touches a role that was set
  manually — it only ever adjusts a role it granted itself.

---

## Moderation API

The dashboard's moderation endpoints are backed directly by the same manager classes that power the in-game `/ban`, `/mute`, `/kick`, `/warn`, `/note`, and `/report` commands (see [Moderation System](ModerationSystem)) — there is no separate dashboard-only ban store, so actions taken here actually enforce in-game and vice versa. The dashboard's own accounts (`dashboard_users`, `dashboard_registrations`) are themselves persisted through the same pluggable backend — see [Storage Backend](Storage).

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/moderation/overview` | GET | Summary counts across all moderation categories |
| `/api/moderation/bans/active`, `/bans`, `/bans/{uuid}` | GET | Active bans / all bans / a player's ban history |
| `/api/moderation/ban` | POST | Issue a ban |
| `/api/moderation/ban/{uuid}` | DELETE | Unban a player |
| `/api/moderation/ipbans/active`, `/ipbans` | GET | Active IP bans / all IP ban history |
| `/api/moderation/ipban` | POST | Issue an IP ban |
| `/api/moderation/ipban/{ip}` | DELETE | Unban an IP |
| `/api/moderation/mutes/active`, `/mutes`, `/mutes/{name}` | GET | Active mutes / all mutes / a player's mute history |
| `/api/moderation/mute` | POST | Issue a mute |
| `/api/moderation/mute/{name}` | DELETE | Unmute a player |
| `/api/moderation/ipmutes` | GET | All IP mutes |
| `/api/moderation/ipmute` | POST | Issue an IP mute |
| `/api/moderation/ipmute/{ip}` | DELETE | Remove an IP mute |
| `/api/moderation/kicks`, `/kicks/{name}` | GET | Kick history (all / one player) |
| `/api/moderation/warns`, `/warns/{name}` | GET | Warnings (all / one player) |
| `/api/moderation/warn/{id}` | DELETE | Remove a warning |
| `/api/moderation/notes/{name}` | GET | A player's staff notes |
| `/api/moderation/note` | POST | Add a staff note |
| `/api/moderation/note/{id}` | DELETE | Remove a staff note |
| `/api/moderation/reports`, `/reports/all`, `/reports/{id}` | GET | Pending / all / one report |
| `/api/moderation/reports/{id}/review` | POST | Accept or dismiss a report |
| `/api/moderation/freeze/list` | GET | Currently-frozen players |
| `/api/moderation/freeze` | POST | Freeze a player |
| `/api/moderation/freeze/{name}` | DELETE | Unfreeze a player |
| `/api/moderation/vanish/list` | GET | Currently-vanished players |
| `/api/moderation/vanish` | POST | Vanish/unvanish a player |
| `/api/moderation/vanish/{name}` | DELETE | Force a player visible |
| `/api/moderation/jails`, `/jail-locations` | GET | Jailed players / configured jail cell locations |
| `/api/moderation/jail`, `/jail-location` | POST | Jail a player / define a jail cell location |
| `/api/moderation/jail/{name}`, `/jail-location/{name}` | DELETE | Release a player / remove a jail cell location |

All routes above require the standard dashboard Bearer-token authentication (session or API key); mutating routes (POST/DELETE) additionally require the **ADMIN** role specifically — a MODERATOR-role credential can read but not act.

### Public Moderation Lookup (no login required)

A separate, unauthenticated set of routes — matching ban-management plugins' public
transparency page, where anyone can look up a player's punishment history without an account:

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/public/moderation/lookup/{name}` | GET | Bans, mutes, kicks, and warns for one player, by name |
| `/api/public/moderation/recent` | GET | Recent active bans + mutes across all players, newest first |

These deliberately **never** expose IP bans, IP mutes, staff notes, or player reports (privacy —
notes/reports contain staff commentary and a reporter's identity). Still CORS/rate-limited the
same as every other dashboard route, just without the Bearer-token check. Gated by
`webDashboard.securitySettings.publicModerationLookupEnabled` (default `true`) — set to `false`
to disable public lookup entirely.

### In-Chat "View Profile" Link

Player names in chat show a small clickable `↗` icon that opens that player's public lookup
page in a browser. By default this points at whichever NeoEssentials dashboard is actually
reachable — the paired external (Laravel) dashboard if you've run `/dashboard pair`, else the
mod's own bundled UI via `webDashboard.publicUrl`.

If you have your own website instead (a stats page, forum profile, custom fan site), set
`webDashboard.customProfileUrlTemplate` to point the link there instead — it takes priority over
both of the above when set:

```json
"customProfileUrlTemplate": "https://myserver.com/players/{player}"
```

Supports `{player}` (URL-encoded username) and `{uuid}` placeholders. Leave empty (the default)
to keep using one of the two dashboards.

## Commands

All `/dashboard` subcommands (including the bare `/dashboard`) require `neoessentials.admin.dashboard`
— this is checked on the `dashboard` literal itself, so `pair`/`unpair` need it **in addition to**
`neoessentials.dashboard.pair` listed below (brigadier requires every node from the root down to
pass, not just the leaf). Account registration is a **separate** command tree, `/dashboardregister`,
gated by `neoessentials.dashboard.access`.

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Show the REST API + WebSocket server's status |
| `/dashboard start` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Start the API server if stopped |
| `/dashboard stop` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Stop the API server |
| `/dashboard restart` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Restart the API server |
| `/dashboard status` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Show the API server's status |
| `/dashboard url` | `neoessentials.admin.dashboard` | Show the API base URL |
| `/dashboard pair "<dashboardUrl>" <code>` | `neoessentials.dashboard.pair` | Complete the pairing handshake with an external dashboard — see [API System → Pairing](APISystem#pairing) |
| `/dashboard unpair` | `neoessentials.dashboard.pair` | Clear the paired connection and revoke its API key |
| `/dashboardregister` | `neoessentials.dashboard.access` | Show registration help |
| `/dashboardregister start` | `neoessentials.dashboard.access` | Begin manual registration (issues a 5-minute token) |
| `/dashboardregister complete <username> <password>` | `neoessentials.dashboard.access` | Finish manual registration |
| `/dashboardregister discord` | `neoessentials.dashboard.access` | Register instantly using a linked Discord account (via SDLink, Mc2Discord, or DCIntegration) |
| `/dashboardregister status` | `neoessentials.dashboard.access` | Check your registration status |
| `/apikey create <label> [role]` | `neoessentials.dashboard.apikeys` | Create an API key for an external dashboard backend — prints the token once, as a click-to-copy chat component |
| `/apikey list` | `neoessentials.dashboard.apikeys` | List keys (label/role/enabled/last-used — never the secret) |
| `/apikey revoke <id>` | `neoessentials.dashboard.apikeys` | Revoke a key immediately |
| `/linkaccount <code>` | none — open to everyone | Finish linking your Minecraft account to a dashboard account, using the code shown on that account's Settings page |

`/apikey` is a **separate** command tree from `/dashboard`/`/dashboardregister` — see
[API System → Authentication](APISystem#authentication) for the full picture of what these
keys are for and how they differ from a human dashboard account. `/linkaccount` is the reverse
direction of `/dashboardregister` — it links an MC account to an *existing* dashboard account
(started from the dashboard's own Settings page), rather than creating a brand-new dashboard
account starting from an in-game player.
