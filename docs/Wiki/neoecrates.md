## Overview

Keys, weighted reward pools, and an animated GUI reveal (like the Spigot plugin
ExcellentCrates), openable either virtually (`/crate open`) or by right-clicking a physical
crate block placed in the world.

[Votifier](votifier) can be configured to grant crate keys as a vote reward — the common "vote
crate" server setup — but the two systems work fully independently too.

---

## Keys — two independent wallets

A player can hold crate keys two ways, fully independently of each other:

- **Virtual balance** (`/crate key give\|take`) — a non-transferable per-player count
  (`CrateKeyManager`, mirrors how the economy balance works). Can't be given away, dropped, or
  stolen; only ever spent by that specific player.
- **Physical key item** (`/crate key giveitem`) — a real, giveable `ItemStack` tagged to one
  crate. Holding a valid one is by itself enough to open that crate (right-clicking a crate
  block, or holding it when using `/crate open`) — it doesn't touch or require any virtual
  balance. Consuming the item (shrinking the stack by one) is what prevents reuse, so it's safe
  to give, drop, or trade between players like any other item; whoever ends up holding it can
  redeem it.

`/crate admin setkey <crate>` sets the key item to *whatever you're holding* — any vanilla or
modded item, with its full NBT/components (enchantments, custom model data, existing lore, etc)
preserved, the same way crate rewards support modded items. There's no restriction to a fixed
item list.

### Display names — `displayName` vs `chatDisplayName` vs `crateKeyDisplayName`

A crate has three separate display-name concepts, because each is shown through a different
channel with different animation capabilities:

- **`displayName`** — the crate's visual identity, shown in its hologram line (via
  `/crate admin setblock`'s auto-created hologram) and its GUI titles (open/preview menus). These
  can genuinely re-render, so `{animation:NAME}`/`<gradient:...>`/`<rainbow>` here actually
  animate/refresh live, same as any other hologram text.
- **`chatDisplayName`** *(optional, `/crate admin setchatname <crate> <name>`)* — used in every
  chat/command-feedback message (no keys, no rewards, reward-added, keys given/taken, block set,
  the "won a rare reward" broadcast, etc). A chat message is one line appended to an append-only
  log, delivered once and never touched again — there's no packet channel to "animate" it
  afterward the way a hologram/tablist/scoreboard line can be continuously re-sent. If
  `displayName` uses `{animation:NAME}`, reusing it here would resolve a *different* random
  snapshot frame in every single message, which reads as inconsistent/flickery rather than
  animated. Falls back to `displayName` if not set (existing crates keep working unchanged) —
  set this explicitly to a plain colored string whenever `displayName` is animated.
- **`crateKeyDisplayName`** *(optional, `/crate admin setkeyname <crate> <name>`)* — the physical
  key item's name. Same one-shot-snapshot limitation as chat: an item sitting in someone's
  inventory can't be repainted, so an animated name here is a snapshot of whichever frame was
  current the moment that specific key was minted, not something that animates while held — give
  out a batch of keys over time and each one can show a different frame. Falls back to
  `"&6" + displayName + " Key"` if not set.

Right-clicking a crate block prefers a valid physical key in your hand first, and only falls
back to your virtual balance if you aren't holding one.

## Config (`crates.json`)

Crates are primarily authored as config (like `leaderboard.json` boards) — in-game admin
commands are convenience helpers on top, not a full editor:

```jsonc
"crates": {
  "common": {
    "displayName": "&7Common Crate",
    // "chatDisplayName": "&7Common Crate",     // optional, see Display names above
    // "crateKeyDisplayName": "&7Common Key",   // optional, see Display names above
    "block": "minecraft:chest",          // cosmetic only
    "animation": "roulette",              // "roulette" | "sequential" | "instant"
    "keyItem": { "item": "minecraft:tripwire_hook", "count": 1 },
    "rewards": [
      { "id": "diamonds", "weight": 30, "item": { "item": "minecraft:diamond", "count": 3 } },
      { "id": "emerald_block", "weight": 5, "item": { "item": "minecraft:emerald_block", "count": 1 },
        "broadcastRare": true, "broadcastMessage": "&6{player} won an Emerald Block!" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`weight` is relative (doesn't need to sum to 100). Reward items support full item data
(enchantments, custom names, etc. — same `{item, count, components}` serialization `kits.json`
already uses). `broadcastRare` + `broadcastMessage` (`{player}` substituted) announces
server-wide when that specific reward is won.

## Opening animations

- **`roulette`** — a CS:GO-style horizontal strip scrolls and decelerates onto the winning
  reward, ~3-4 seconds.
- **`sequential`** — a handful of slots flicker random rewards a few times before settling,
  ~1.5 seconds — much lighter than roulette.
- **`instant`** — no animation, reward granted and announced immediately.

The reward is always resolved **before** the animation starts — the animation only reveals an
already-determined outcome, it never influences it.

## Physical crate blocks

`/crate admin setblock <crate>` while looking directly at a block registers that exact world
position as a live instance of the crate:
- **Right-click** it (with a key, physical or virtual) to open it.
- **Left-click** it to show the reward-odds preview at no cost — same as `/crate preview`.
  Shift+left-click bypasses the preview and falls through as a normal break attempt.

`/crate admin removeblock` unregisters. This is a position-mapping (like a ChestShop sign), not
a new custom block type — any vanilla block works, purely cosmetic.

`setblock` also auto-creates a floating [Hologram](HologramSystem) above the block (default:
the crate's display name + "Right-click to open!"), requires `modules.hologramEnabled`.
It's a completely ordinary hologram — same registry, same `/hologram` commands — just given a
predictable id based on the crate's own name (`crate_<crateId>`, e.g. `crate_common`) so it's
actually findable in `/hologram` tab-completion, not an opaque coordinate string. If that crate
already has another physical block's hologram using the base name, later ones get a numeric
suffix (`crate_common_2`, `crate_common_3`, ...) — the block → hologram link is tracked
internally, so this stays correct even if you move the hologram elsewhere with
`/hologram moveto`/`movehere`. Customize it with any `/hologram` subcommand:
`/hologram setline crate_common 2 &6Rare loot inside!`, plus scale, spin, background color,
hover animation, or anything else `/hologram` supports. `removeblock` removes it again;
`/crate admin reload` and `/crate admin delete` sweep away any hologram left over a block whose
crate no longer exists.
