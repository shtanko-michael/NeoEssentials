/**
 * Marks (and purges) display-only "ghost" item stacks — the reward-icon stacks shown in
 * {@code /crate preview} and the opening reveal GUI.
 *
 * <p>{@link com.zerog.neoessentials.util.ReadOnlyContainer} blocks every normal way of removing
 * an item from those GUIs (the click-packet path, and every {@code Container} mutation method),
 * but that only stops code that tries to <i>take</i> an item out. Some client-side
 * inventory-utility mods (confirmed: Quark's item-pull feature) don't take anything from the
 * container at all — they just read a slot's item and copy it straight into the player's real
 * inventory, a path no container-level defense can close without also breaking the ability to
 * render the preview in the first place.
 *
 * <p>So instead of trying to stop the copy, every ghost stack this mod displays carries a hidden
 * marker, and {@link #sweep} strips any stack carrying it out of a player's real inventory —
 * wherever it came from, however it got there. Both crate GUIs run a sweep on a short timer
 * while open, then {@link #sweepWithGracePeriod} a few more times over the couple of seconds
 * after they close, so an exfiltrated copy never survives long enough to be useful. This is
 * deliberately mod-agnostic: it doesn't matter which mod or mechanism did the copying.
 *
 * <p>The grace period exists because closing the GUI stops the periodic sweep immediately, but
 * doesn't guarantee the extraction itself has already been fully processed server-side — a
 * player clicking a pull button and then immediately hitting E/Esc to close could still win the
 * race and keep a copy that lands a tick or two after the close-triggered sweep already ran,
 * with no menu left open for the next periodic sweep to ever catch it.
